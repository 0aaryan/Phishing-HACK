Hackathon conducted by `VIT Chennai` named `VITISH-2023`, to work on a 24-hour nonstop hackathon to work on the problem statement,
  ``
 
# Work done 

1. Created a full stack interactive website to detect whether the link is a Phishing link or not, based upon 3 different attributes:
  ``` 
    a. Their VPN location 
    b. Plotting the location to check if they are using a VPN bouncing strategy to hide their real IP.
    c. Using Two different machine learning models 
1. Use Levenshtein algothrim to compare the given URL with the other 10,000 genuine links.
2. Using an ANN model to test whether the link is phishing or not using by giving the probability between 0 and 1.
   ```    
        
2. Created an extension using JS to get all the links from any webpage and using two different models of machine learning tested whether the link is Phishing or not.
   ```
    a. Using the ANN model to test positivity, with an accuracy of 92 % and a dataset size being size of 11000+, with 19 features.
    b. For the sub urls in the given links using another ML model with 9 features to test its positivity over dataset size being 3L+
   ```
